# Hi, I'm Andrea! 👋

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in *Computer Engineering - Web Information and Data Engineering* at the University of Padova (UNIPD) while working as a software developer at [MyCIA](https://healthyfood.srl/) since 2022.

I specialize in **PHP** and **Python** development, though my academic background has also given me strong skills in **C/C++** and **Java**. I also have a basic knowledge of **JavaScript** and markup languages like **HTML** and **LaTeX**. I regularly use tools like **Git** (GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitea) and **Docker** to streamline my development workflow.

Currently, I'm focusing on **topic modeling** as part of my Master's thesis, driven by my fascination with text analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- **Languages**: PHP, Python, C/C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, LaTeX
- **Frameworks**: Laravel, Spring, Apache Spark
- **Tools**: Git, Docker

## 🚀 Current Projects
- **[MyCIA](https://healthyfood.srl/)**: I work as a backend developer, focusing on building scalable solutions and improving feature implementations.
- **[Song Lyrics Analysis Tool]** *(In development)*: A personal project where I am creating a tool to analyze song lyrics.
- *Other secret projects at the intersection of music and IT* 👀

## 🎯 Future Goals
I aim to continue deepening my expertise in **topic modeling** and text analysis, while honing my skills in **web development** and **data engineering**. I'm also looking forward to contributing more to open-source projects in these areas.

## 🎵 Personal Interests
As you may have noticed, I'm passionate about both **music** and **programming**! I enjoy finding innovative ways to merge these two worlds, whether it's through building tools to analyze song lyrics or exploring how data can provide new insights into musical trends.

In addition to my technical projects, I also contribute to a music magazine on Instagram, where I write about various topics related to music culture, trends, and new releases. Feel free to check out the magazine here: [Usare Gang](https://www.instagram.com/usare_gang/) 🎶
